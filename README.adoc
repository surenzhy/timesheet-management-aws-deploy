# timesheet-management-aws-deploy
Deploying Microservices on AWS Cloud

# Problem Statement

=== Business Requirements
* A new starter business a timesheet management application that will be used by end users for following actions 
* Users should be able to login to the application
* Users will upload the timesheet data in excel format
* Administrators can view the uploaded timesheet in user friendly format

=== Technical Requirements
* The application needs to support following technical requirements
* The application should follow DDD and microservices architecture 
* The application should use the Netflix stack and should be hosted on AWS
* The data should be stored in JSON format in the database (DynamoDB)

# Solution

=== Context Map

The following diagram shows the DDD for the problem statement. This is the context map for the problem statement that shows the domain and subdomain.

=== DDD â€“ Microservices decomposition

The following diagram shows the decomposition of microservices derived from the context map of the DDD.

=== Logical Architecture

The following diagram shows the logical architecture of the application. 
The microservices in this architecture is layered by purpose (systems, processes (or domain models) and experience). The complexity of the architecture can be managed easily.

=== CI/CD

* The developer will commit code on Github.
* The CodePipeline will poll source code for changes.
* The CodeBuild will run unit test, build a docker image, and push the image to ECR.
* The CodeDeploy will execute a deployment script to deploy application on ECS.
